“Why are you interested in this role?”

I recently participated in GE's job simulation on the Forage platform, gaining
valuable insights into what it's like to be part of GE's digital technology
team. 
I worked on a project focused on creating a Vue.js UI for the team, as well as
exploring strategies to align technical specifications with business
requirements. I practiced using Vue SFC Playground and built my frontend
development skills in a real-world context. 
This experience confirmed my passion for solving technical challenges, and I'm
enthusiastic about applying these skills on GE's digital technology team to
contribute to meaningful solutions.

## Top tips for a successful job application

Applications are competitive, and many companies don’t review every application they receive. Importantly, it’s never too early to start building your work experience, you should start preparing from day one at university.
Here are Forage’s top tips for a successful application

- Attend recruitment events
  Often, recruiters decide which applicants to review and progress to the interview based on who impressed them at events. Increase your odds by attending events either virtually or in person. Introduce yourself, speak about your job simulation experience, and follow up with a thoughtful email or LinkedIn message.
- Apply ASAP when a job opens
  Many companies start interviewing and making offers as soon as the job opens. The earlier you apply, the more positions will be available and the greater your chances of success. Don’t wait until the application deadline.
- Apply for different locations
  Jobs in major cities receive a much larger number of applications than jobs in smaller cities. Consider applying to different locations to increase your chances of landing an interview.

What are these types of programs?
Most companies have early identification or introductory programs designed to build relationships with top candidates before you’re eligible to apply for internships.
These programs are generally less competitive, as recruiters know you won’t have much previous experience.
Programs have different names based on the company, for example: Early Insight or Pre-Internship Programs, Leadership Programs, Virtual Insight Series, Women in Industry etc.
Find available programs on your Apply page, or in the careers section on a company’s website. On a careers page, look for categories like “Students & Undergraduates” and “Pre-Internship Opportunities.”

Top tips to stand out at events
