## Technical Requirements for Supply Chain Feature
## Business Requirements: 
To create a supply chain system which gives optimal time to order new plane parts. Also, it should be easily integrable with the current platform to be used.

## Technical Requirements: 
    • Data Access: 
        ◦ We will access the data for date of last part replacement, the average time between replacements and estimated shipping times. 
        ◦ We will also access the weather information for the days it has been shipped from seller to us. It will help us create a record for estimated shipping time for different weathers.
    • Machine Learning: 
        ◦ We will train a model based upon the different data parameters we access and create a visual representation on our current platform. 
        ◦ The model will tell us perfect time to order our product based upon the product we need after what time interval, based upon the weather in which we get the product as quick as possible.
        
## Key Metrics: 
The performance of this system should be measured using the following key metrics:
    1. Date of last replacement.
    2. Average time between replacements.
    3. Estimated shipping time.
    4. Weather conditions during each shipping.
